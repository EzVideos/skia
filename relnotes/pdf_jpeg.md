`SkPDF::MakeDocument(SkWStream*)` [one argument] has been deprecated and will be removed. This is because SkPDFMetdata has added 2 required fields `jpegDecoder` and `jpegEncoder`. In order to make a reasonable PDF, those must be supplied (using the two argument factory). To make these easier to supply `include/docs/SkPDFJpegHelpers.h` has been added, which will use Skia's built-in jpeg encoder and decoder.
